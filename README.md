# Prove It Series - Prime Number Challenge

This challenge comes from the iamtimcorey course (link below), the prove it series, the Prime Number Challenge.

## GOAL

Create a console app that can identify if a given number is a prime number (a number that cannot be divided by anything but 1 and itself). Don't depend on Console.WriteLine.

## BONUS

Get all the factors of a given number (besides 1 and itself). Also, get a list of all prime factors for a given number. When a number is given, print out how many unique factors go into it, the list of unique prime factors, and what the largest prime factor is.
